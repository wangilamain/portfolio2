 <h1>About me</h1>
 <p>My name is Sharon Wawira.I am twenty two years old.I am a student at
    Moringa School doing software development(Programming).
    I have studied upto university level(undergraduate). At the univesity,
    i studied Computer Science .
    I decided to take a path in the programming field since I have always had
    passion for coding and also need a job.I love sleeping and eating.Am a good
    singer and dancer as well.I also do alot of bead work as a hobby.I enjoy
    watching movies and alone time.This helps me think alot about myself in
    general.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>I have done a couple of projects some of which were a disappointment
    to me since they did perform the objectives required.Above all i have
    done a project recently that is quite good to my point of view.Here is 
    are links of projets i have done;</p>
