<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Sharon Wwawira.I am twenty two years old.I am a student at
  Moringa School doing software development(Programming).
  I have studied upto university level(undergraduate). At the univesity,
  i studied Computer Science .
  I decided to take a path in the programming field since I have always had
  passion for coding and also need a job.I love sleeping and eating.Am a good
  singer and dancer as well.I also do alot of bead work as a hobby.I enjoy
  watching movies and alone time.This helps me think alot about myself in
  general.</p>
